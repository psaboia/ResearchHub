# Documentation Generation Exercise

## Overview
This exercise teaches participants how to use AI to generate comprehensive documentation for complex, undocumented functions. The goal is to learn how providing context improves the quality of AI-generated documentation.

## Target Functions

### Function 1: `calculate_data_quality_metrics` (lines 168-245)
- **Purpose**: Assesses data quality across multiple dimensions
- **Complexity**: 78 lines, multiple quality metrics, configurable rules
- **Challenge**: Understanding statistical concepts and business context

### Function 2: `process_research_workflow` (lines 248-357)
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates multi-step data processing workflows
- **Complexity**: 110 lines, multiple workflow types, error handling
- **Challenge**: Understanding workflow patterns and data pipeline concepts

## Part 1: Initial Documentation Attempt (3 minutes)

### Step 1: Basic Prompt
```bash
# Open the file in Cursor or your AI tool
# Navigate to line 168 (calculate_data_quality_metrics)
```

**Try this poor prompt first:**
```
"Document this function"
```

**Expected Result:**
- Generic description
- Missing business context
- Incomplete parameter descriptions
- No usage examples

**Save this output to compare later**

### Step 2: Analyze What's Missing
Look at the AI's response and identify:
- What parameters are not explained?
- What does the function actually return?
- How would someone use this function?
- What validation rules format is expected?

## Part 2: Adding Context (8 minutes)

### Step 3: Improved Prompt with Context

**Better prompt with some context:**
```
"Document the calculate_data_quality_metrics function.
This is used in a research data management platform where scientists upload datasets.
The function validates data quality before researchers share data across institutions.
Include parameter descriptions and return value structure."
```

**Expected Improvement:**
- Better understanding of purpose
- Some business context
- Still missing usage examples
- Validation rules format unclear

### Step 4: Comprehensive Context Prompt

**Excellent prompt with full context:**
```
"Generate comprehensive documentation for the calculate_data_quality_metrics function including:

Context: This function is part of a research data management system where data quality is critical for scientific validity. Poor quality data can invalidate research results and waste millions in research funding.

Please include:
1. Purpose and business importance
2. Detailed parameter descriptions:
   - dataset_id: UUID of the dataset to analyze
   - validation_rules: List of rule dictionaries with 'type', 'column', and type-specific fields
   - threshold_config: Dictionary mapping metric types to weights for scoring
3. Return value structure with all possible fields
4. Quality grade meanings (A-D) and their implications for research
5. Complete usage example showing:
   - Basic usage without rules
   - Advanced usage with validation rules
   - Example with regex pattern for email validation
   - Example with range validation for temperature data
6. Error handling and edge cases
7. Performance considerations for large datasets

The function calculates completeness, validity, consistency, and accuracy metrics.
Quality grades determine if data can be shared: A/B = shareable, C = needs review, D = blocked."
```

## Part 3: Documenting Complex Workflows (6 minutes)

### Step 5: Document process_research_workflow

**Initial attempt:**
```
"Document the process_research_workflow function"
```

**With full context:**
```
"Document the process_research_workflow function which orchestrates multi-step data processing pipelines in a research platform.

Context: Research projects often require complex data processing workflows like:
- Validating multiple datasets
- Cross-referencing between datasets
- Statistical analysis
- Data transformation

Include:
1. Purpose and use cases in research workflows
2. Parameter structure:
   - project_id: UUID of the research project
   - workflow_config: Dictionary with 'steps' array, each step having 'type' and 'parameters'
3. Supported step types:
   - data_validation: Validates all unprocessed datasets in project
   - cross_reference: Merges two datasets
   - statistical_analysis: Performs correlation analysis
4. Return value structure including:
   - steps: Array of completed steps with results
   - errors: Array of failed steps
   - warnings: Data quality warnings
   - overall_status: success/failed/completed_with_warnings
5. Complete workflow example:
   - Multi-step validation and merge workflow
   - Error handling demonstration
   - Warning threshold configuration
6. Side effects:
   - Creates DataProcessingJob records
   - Generates merged datasets
   - Logs audit trails
7. Best practices for workflow design"
```

## Part 4: Practical Exercise (3 minutes)

### Step 6: Create Your Own Documentation

Choose one aspect to document in detail:

**Option A: Validation Rules Format**
```
Create a comprehensive guide for validation_rules parameter:
- All supported rule types
- Required fields for each type
- Complex rule examples
- Common validation patterns for research data
```

**Option B: Workflow Configuration Schema**
```
Create a JSON schema for workflow_config:
- All step types
- Required parameters for each
- Optional parameters
- Example workflows for common research scenarios
```

**Option C: Error Handling Guide**
```
Document all possible errors:
- What exceptions can occur
- Recovery strategies
- Logging and monitoring
- User-friendly error messages
```

## Progressive Prompt Examples

### Level 1: Poor (No Context)
```
"What does this function do?"
```
**Result:** Vague, technical description without business meaning

### Level 2: Basic Context
```
"Explain this data quality function used in research"
```
**Result:** Better purpose but missing details

### Level 3: Good Context
```
"Document this data quality assessment function for research datasets.
Include parameters, return values, and how quality grades affect data sharing."
```
**Result:** Useful documentation but missing examples

### Level 4: Excellent Context
```
"Generate production-ready documentation for calculate_data_quality_metrics:
- Used by research institutions to validate scientific data
- Quality grades determine if data meets publication standards
- Include docstring, parameter types, return schema
- Add 3 real-world usage examples with different validation rules
- Explain the statistical methods (IQR for outliers)
- Note performance impact on files >1GB"
```
**Result:** Complete, useful documentation ready for production

## Expected Documentation Output

### Good Documentation Should Include:

```python
def calculate_data_quality_metrics(dataset_id, validation_rules=None, threshold_config=None):
    """
    Assess data quality metrics for research datasets to ensure scientific validity.

    This function performs comprehensive quality assessment across multiple dimensions
    (completeness, consistency, validity, accuracy) and assigns a quality grade that
    determines whether data can be shared across research institutions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset_id : str (UUID)
        Unique identifier of the dataset to analyze.

    validation_rules : list of dict, optional
        Custom validation rules to apply. Each rule dictionary must contain:
        - 'type': 'range' or 'regex'
        - 'column': Column name to validate
        For 'range' type:
        - 'min': Minimum allowed value
        - 'max': Maximum allowed value
        For 'regex' type:
        - 'pattern': Regular expression pattern

    threshold_config : dict, optional
        Weights for calculating overall score. Default:
        {'completeness': 0.3, 'validity': 0.3, 'consistency': 0.4}

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Quality metrics including:
        - 'completeness': Dict of column completeness percentages
        - 'consistency': Dict of validation rule violations
        - 'validity': Dict of outlier information per column
        - 'accuracy': Dict of accuracy metrics (if applicable)
        - 'overall_score': Weighted score (0-100)
        - 'quality_grade': A (>90), B (>75), C (>60), or D (â‰¤60)
        - 'timestamp': ISO format timestamp of assessment

    Examples
    --------
    Basic usage:
    >>> metrics = calculate_data_quality_metrics('dataset-uuid-123')
    >>> print(f"Quality Grade: {metrics['quality_grade']}")

    With validation rules:
    >>> rules = [
    ...     {'type': 'range', 'column': 'temperature', 'min': -50, 'max': 50},
    ...     {'type': 'regex', 'column': 'email', 'pattern': r'^[a-zA-Z0-9+_.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$'}
    ... ]
    >>> metrics = calculate_data_quality_metrics('dataset-uuid-123', validation_rules=rules)

    Notes
    -----
    - Quality grades A/B allow immediate data sharing
    - Grade C requires manual review before sharing
    - Grade D blocks sharing until issues are resolved
    - Large datasets (>1GB) may take several minutes to process
    - Creates a DataProcessingJob record for audit trail
    """
```

## Teaching Points

### Key Concepts to Emphasize:

1. **Context is Crucial**
   - Business context changes everything
   - Domain knowledge improves documentation quality
   - User perspective matters

2. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Start simple, add detail
   - Each iteration reveals what's missing
   - Build on AI responses

3. **Documentation Components**
   - Purpose (why it exists)
   - Parameters (what goes in)
   - Returns (what comes out)
   - Examples (how to use it)
   - Edge cases (when it fails)
   - Performance (scalability concerns)

4. **Asking the Right Questions**
   - What problem does this solve?
   - Who will use this?
   - What can go wrong?
   - What's the expected input format?

### Common Documentation Mistakes:
- Too technical without business context
- Missing parameter format/structure
- No usage examples
- Ignoring error cases
- Not explaining side effects

### Discussion Questions:
1. "How did context change the documentation quality?"
2. "What information would a new developer need?"
3. "How would you document for different audiences?"
4. "What makes documentation maintainable?"
